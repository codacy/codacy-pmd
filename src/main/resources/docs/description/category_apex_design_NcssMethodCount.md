Since: PMD 5.5.0

This rule uses the NCSS (Non-Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines
of code for a given method. NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm,
lines of code that are split are counted as one.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo extends Bar {
    //this method only has 1 NCSS lines
    public Integer methd() {
        super.methd();



        return 1;
    }
}
```
