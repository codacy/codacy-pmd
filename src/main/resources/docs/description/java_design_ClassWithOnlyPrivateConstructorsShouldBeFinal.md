A `class` with only `private` constructors should be `final`, unless the `private` constructor is invoked by a inner `class`.
A `class` with a `private` constructor cannot be extended, so it should be marked as `final`.

Adding `final` to all things that shouldn't change is a good practice, doing this explicity shows the intention of the code.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {  //Should be final
  private Foo() { }
}
```
