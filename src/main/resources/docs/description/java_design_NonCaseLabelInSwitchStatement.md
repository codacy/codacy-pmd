A non-case label (e.g. a named `break`/`continue` label) was present in a `switch` statement. This is legal, but confusing. It is easy to mix up the `case` labels and the non-case labels.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  void bar(int a) {
    switch (a) {
      case 1:
      // do something
      break;
      mylabel: // this is legal, but confusing!
      break;
      default:
      break;
    }
  }
}
```
