Calling new `Long()` causes memory allocation that can be avoided by the `static Long.valueOf()`. It makes use of an internal cache that recycles earlier instances making it more memory efficient.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
	private Long i = new Long(0); // change to Long i = Long.valueOf(0);
}
```
