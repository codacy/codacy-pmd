`Private` methods are only accessible inside the class where they were defined.

Any `private` method not used inside the class is useless, should be removed.

Ex:

```   
public class Something
{
  private void foo() // unused
  {
    System.out.println(\"This method is never invoked!\");
  }
}
```
