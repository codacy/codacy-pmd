If an abstract class does not provides any methods, it may be acting as a simple data container that is not meant to be instantiated.
In this case, it is probably better to use a private or protected constructor in order to prevent instantiation than make the class misleadingly abstract.

Ex:

```
//Is this a data container?
public class abstract BadExample {
    String field;
    int otherField;
}

//This is a better approach
public class  GoodExample {
    String field;
    int otherField;

    private GoodExample() {
        //With private constructor prohibits instantiation
    }
}
```
