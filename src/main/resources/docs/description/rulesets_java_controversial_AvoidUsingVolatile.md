Since: PMD 4.1

Use of the keyword 'volatile' is generally used to fine tune a Java application, and therefore, requires
a good expertise of the Java Memory Model. Moreover, its range of action is somewhat misknown. Therefore,
the volatile keyword should not be used for maintenance purpose and portability.

Example(s):
```
public class ThrDeux {
  private volatile String var1; // not suggested
  private          String var2; // preferred
}
```
