If a `final` field is assigned to a compile-time constant, it could be made `static`, thus saving overhead in each object at runtime.
If its value is defined at compile time, then there is no reason to copy it for every object of the `class` where it was declared.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  public final int BAR = 42; // this should be static
}
```
