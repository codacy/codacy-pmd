Since: PMD 1.2

A variable naming conventions rule - customize this to your liking.  Currently, it
checks for final variables that should be fully capitalized and non-final variables
that should not include underscores.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    public static final int MY_NUM = 0;
    public String myTest = "";
    DataModule dmTest = new DataModule();
}
```
