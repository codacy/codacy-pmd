Do not use `protected` fields in `final` classes since they cannot be subclassed. Clarify your intent by using `private` or `package` access modifiers instead.
In this case, the `protected` instead of `private` will only expose it to the `package` level.
At this point, (final class), you should choose between `public`, `private`, or no modifier (`package` access).
If the intention is it to have `package` access level, then you should put no modifier keyword, this way you will get `package` access.
Doing this you clearly state to other readers what is the purpose and accessibility of the field.

Ex:

```
public final class Bar {
  private int x;
  protected int y;  // bar cannot be subclassed, so is y really private or package visible?
  Bar() {

  }
}
```
