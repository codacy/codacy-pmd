This rule uses the NCSS (Non-Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines of code for a given type.

**NCSS ignores comments**, and counts actual statements.

Using this algorithm, **lines of code that are split are counted as one**.

Ex:

```
	public class Foo extends Bar {
		public Foo() {


		//this class only has 6 NCSS lines
		super();
		super.foo();
		}
	}
```
