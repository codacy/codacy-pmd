A method should have only one exit point, and that should be the last statement in the method.
This notion of "Single Entry, Single Exit" is a bit hold, and somehow deprecated, but it's usage still have some advantages.
If you want to add something before the function return (like a print or something), it's much easier if you have only one exit point.

Ex:

```
public class OneReturnOnly1 {
  public void foo(int x) {
    if (x > 0) {
      return "hey";   // first exit
    }
    return "hi";	// second exit
  }
}
```
