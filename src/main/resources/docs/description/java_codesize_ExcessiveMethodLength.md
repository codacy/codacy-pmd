When methods are excessively long this usually indicates that **the method is doing more than its name/signature might suggest**. They also become challenging for others to digest since excessive scrolling causes readers to lose focus. Try to reduce the method length by creating helper methods and removing any copy/pasted code.

Ex:

```
public void doSomething() {
	System.out.println("Hello world!");
	System.out.println("Hello world!");
	// 98 copies omitted for brevity.
	//Don't do this!
}

//Do this instead
public void doSomething() {
	helper1();
	helper2();
	//other helpers
	}

public void helper1() {
	//insert code
}

public void helper2() {
	//insert code
}
```
