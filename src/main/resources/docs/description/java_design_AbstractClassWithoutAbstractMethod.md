An abstract class suggests an incomplete implementation, which is to be completed by subclasses implementing the abstract methods.
If the class is intended to be used as a base class only (not to be instantiated directly) a protected constructor can be provided to prevent direct instantiation.

Ex:

```
public abstract class Foo {
  void int method1() { ... }
  void int method2() { ... }
  // consider using abstract methods or removing
  // the abstract modifier and adding protected constructors
}
```
