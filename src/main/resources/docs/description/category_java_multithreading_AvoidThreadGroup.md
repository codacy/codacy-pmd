Avoid using java.lang.ThreadGroup; although it is intended to be used in a threaded environment
it contains methods that are not thread-safe.

Example(s):
```
public class Bar {
    void buz() {
        ThreadGroup tg = new ThreadGroup("My threadgroup");
        tg = new ThreadGroup(tg, "my thread group");
        tg = Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup();
        tg = System.getSecurityManager().getThreadGroup();
    }
}
```
