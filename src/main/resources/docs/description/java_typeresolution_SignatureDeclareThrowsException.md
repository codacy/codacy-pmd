It is unclear which `exceptions` that can be `thrown` from the methods.

It might be difficult to document and understand the vague interfaces so you should use either a `class` derived from `RuntimeException` or a checked `exception`.

Ex:

```
public void methodThrowingException() throws Exception {}
```
