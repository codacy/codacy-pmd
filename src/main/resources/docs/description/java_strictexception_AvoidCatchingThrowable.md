Catching `Throwable` errors is not recommended since its scope is very broad. It includes runtime issues such as `OutOfMemoryError` that should be exposed and managed separately.

Ex:

```
public void bar() {
	try {
     // do something
    } catch (Throwable th) {  // should not catch Throwable
		th.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
```
