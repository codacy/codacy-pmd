`switch` statements without `break` or `return` statements for each `case` option may indicate problematic behaviour.
A `case` without a `break` will continue to run to the next case.
Empty `cases` are ignored as these indicate an intentional fall-through.

Ex:

```
public void bar(int status) {
  switch(status) {
    case CANCELLED:
    doCancelled();
    // break; hm, should this be commented out?
    case NEW:
    doNew();
    // is this really a fall-through?
    case REMOVED:
    doRemoved();
    // what happens if you add another case after this one?
    case OTHER: // empty case - this is interpreted as an intentional fall-through
    case ERROR:
    doErrorHandling();
    break;
  }
}
```
