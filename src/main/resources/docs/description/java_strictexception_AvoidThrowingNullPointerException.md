Avoid throwing `NullPointerExceptions`. These are confusing because most people will assume that the virtual machine threw it. Consider using an `IllegalArgumentException` instead; this will be clearly seen as a programmer-initiated exception.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  void bar() {
    throw new NullPointerException();
  }
}
```
