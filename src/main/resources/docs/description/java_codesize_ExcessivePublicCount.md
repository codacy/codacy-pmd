Classes with large numbers of public methods and attributes require disproportionate testing efforts since combinational side effects grow rapidly and increase risk.

**Refactoring these classes into smaller ones** not only increases testability and reliability but also allows new variations to be developed easily.

Ex:

```
// bad style
public class Foo {
	public String value;
	public Bar something;
	public Variable var;
	// ... more more public attributes ...

	public void doWork() { }
	public void doMoreWork() { }
	public void doWorkAgain() { }
	// ... more more public methods ...
}
```
