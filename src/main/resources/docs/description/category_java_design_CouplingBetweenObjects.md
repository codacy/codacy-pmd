Since: PMD 1.04

This rule counts the number of unique attributes, local variables, and return types within an object. 
A number higher than the specified threshold can indicate a high degree of coupling.

Example(s):
```
import com.Blah;
import org.Bar;
import org.Bardo;

public class Foo {
    private Blah var1;
    private Bar var2;

    //followed by many imports of unique objects
    void ObjectC doWork() {
        Bardo var55;
        ObjectA var44;
        ObjectZ var93;
        return something;
    }
}
```
