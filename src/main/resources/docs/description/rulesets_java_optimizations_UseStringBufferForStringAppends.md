Since: PMD 3.1

The use of the '+=' operator for appending strings causes the JVM to create and use an internal StringBuffer.
If a non-trivial number of these concatenations are being used then the explicit use of a StringBuilder or 
threadsafe StringBuffer is recommended to avoid this.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        String a;
        a = "foo";
        a += " bar";
        // better would be:
        // StringBuilder a = new StringBuilder("foo");
        // a.append(" bar);
    }
}
```
