JUnit tests should include at least one assertion. This makes the tests more robust, and using assert with messages provide the developer a clearer idea of what the test does.

Ex:

```
public class Foo extends TestCase {
  public void testSomething() {
    Bar b = findBar();
    // This is better than having a NullPointerException
    // assertNotNull("bar not found", b);
    b.work();
  }
}
```
