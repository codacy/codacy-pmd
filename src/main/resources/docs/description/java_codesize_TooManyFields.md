Classes that have too many fields can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer fields, possibly through **grouping related fields in new objects**.

For example, a class with individual city/state/zip fields could park them within a single Address field.

Ex:

```
public class Person {
	// too many separate fields int birthYear;
	int birthMonth;
	int birthDate;
	float height;
	float weight;
}

public class Person {
	// this is more manageable
	Date birthDate;
	BodyMeasurements measurements;
}
```
