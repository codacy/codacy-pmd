A suspicious octal escape sequence was found inside a String literal. An octal escape sequence inside a literal String shall consist of a backslash, followed by:

`OctalDigit | OctalDigit OctalDigit | ZeroToThree OctalDigit OctalDigit`

Ex:

```
public void foo() {
	// interpreted as octal 12, followed by character '8'
	System.out.println("suspicious: \128");
}
```
