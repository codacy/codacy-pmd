A non-static initializer block will be called any time a constructor is invoked (just prior to invoking the constructor).
While this is a valid language construct, it is rarely used and is confusing to the reader.

Ex:

```
public class MyClass {
  // this block gets run before any call to a constructor
  {
    System.out.println("I am about to construct myself");
  }
}
```
