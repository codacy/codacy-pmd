Since: PMD 3.9

The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce 
complexity and increase readability.

Example(s):
```
void bar() {    // this is something more complex than it needs to be,
    if (y) {   // it should be broken down into smaller methods or functions
        for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (j > r) {
                doSomething();
                while (f < 5 ) {
                    anotherThing();
                    f -= 27;
                }
            } else {
                tryThis();
            }
        }
    }
    if ( r - n > 45) {
       while (doMagic()) {
          findRabbits();
       }
    }
    try {
        doSomethingDangerous();
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        makeAmends();
    } finally {
        dontDoItAgain();
    }
}
```
