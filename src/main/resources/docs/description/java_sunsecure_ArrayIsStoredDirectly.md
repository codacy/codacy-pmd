Constructors and methods receiving `arrays` should clone objects and store the copy. This prevents future changes from the user from affecting the original `array`.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  private String [] x;
  public void foo (String [] param) { //wrong
    // Don't do this, make a copy of the array at least
    this.x = param;
  }

  public void foo (String [] param) { //right

    this.x = Arrays.copyOf(param, param.length);
  }
}
```
