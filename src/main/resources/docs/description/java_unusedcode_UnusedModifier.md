Fields in interfaces are automatically `public static final`, and methods are `public abstract`.
`Classes` or `interfaces` nested in an `interface` are automatically `public` and `static` (all nested interfaces are automatically `static`).

For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.

Ex:

```
    public interface Foo {
        public abstract void bar(); 		// both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler
        public static final int X = 0; 	    // public, static, and final all ignored
        public static class Bar {} 		    // public, static ignored
        public static interface Baz {} 	    // ditto
    }
    public class Bar {
        public static interface Baz {} // static ignored
    }
```
