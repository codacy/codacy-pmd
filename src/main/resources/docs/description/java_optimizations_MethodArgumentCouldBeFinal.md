A method argument that is never re-assigned within the method can be declared `final`.

It is considered to be good practice to be explicit on whether you wan't (or not) the variable to change it's value when the method is running.

Ex:

```
public void foo1(String param) {
	// do stuff with param never assigning it
}

public void foo2(final String param) {
	// better, do stuff with param never assigning it
}
```
Other Example:

```
public void  setTest(String test) {
	test = test
}
```

If you forget the `this` keyword on a setter the variable you wan't does not get set. However if you used the final keyword on the parameter then the bug would be caught at compile time.
