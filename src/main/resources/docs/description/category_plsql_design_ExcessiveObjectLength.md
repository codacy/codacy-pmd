Since: PMD 5.1

Excessive object line lengths are usually indications that the object may be burdened with excessive 
responsibilities that could be provided by other objects. In breaking these methods
apart the code becomes more managable and ripe for reuse.

Example(s):
```
CREATE OR REPLACE
PACKAGE BODY Foo AS
    PROCEDURE bar1 IS BEGIN
    -- 1000 lines of code
    END bar1;
    PROCEDURE bar2 IS BEGIN
    -- 1000 lines of code
    END bar2;
    PROCEDURE bar3 IS BEGIN
    -- 1000 lines of code
    END bar3;


    PROCEDURE barN IS BEGIN
    -- 1000 lines of code
    END barn;
END;
```
