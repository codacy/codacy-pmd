Integer literals starting with `0 (zero)` are interpreted as an octal value.

A Integer literal starting with `0` may be misleading and introduce a bug,
if starts with `0`, the rest of literal will be interpreted as an octal value.

Ex:
```
    int i = 012;	// set i with 10 not 12
    int j = 010;	// set j with 8 not 10
    k = i * j;		// set k with 80 not 120
```
