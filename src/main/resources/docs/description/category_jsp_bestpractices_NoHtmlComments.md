In a production system, HTML comments increase the payload
between the application server to the client, and serve
little other purpose. Consider switching to JSP comments.

Example(s):
```
<HTML><title>bad example><BODY>
<!-- HTML comment -->
</BODY> </HTML>

<HTML><title>good example><BODY>
<%-- JSP comment --%>
</BODY> </HTML>
```
