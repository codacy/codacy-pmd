Since: PMD 3.5

The null check here is misplaced. If the variable is null a NullPointerException will be thrown.
Either the check is useless (the variable will never be &quot;null&quot;) or it is incorrect.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        if (a.equals(baz) && a != null) {}
        }
}

        

public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        if (a.equals(baz) || a == null) {}
    }
}
```
