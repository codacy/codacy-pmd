Since: PMD 5.5.0

As triggers do not allow methods like regular classes they are less flexible and suited to apply good encapsulation style.
Therefore delegate the triggers work to a regular class (often called Trigger handler class).

Example(s):
```
trigger Accounts on Account (before insert, before update, before delete, after insert, after update, after delete, after undelete) {
    for(Account acc : Trigger.new) {
        if(Trigger.isInsert) {
            // ...
        }

        // ...

        if(Trigger.isDelete) {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```
