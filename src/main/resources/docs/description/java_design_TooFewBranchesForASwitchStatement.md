`switch` statements are intended to be used to support complex branching behaviour.
Using a `switch` for only a few cases is ill-advised, since switches are not as easy to understand as `if-then` statements.
In these cases use the `if-then` statement to increase code readability.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  public void bar() {
    switch (condition) {
      case ONE:
      instruction;
      break;
      default:
      break; // not enough for a 'switch' stmt, a simple 'if' stmt would have been more appropriate
    }
  }
}
```
