`Vector` is analog to the `ArrayList` hence they are very similar.

`ArrayLists` bring to the table a much better performance than `Vectors` when no threads are involved.

Ex:

```
public class SimpleTest extends TestCase {
  public void testX() {
    Collection c1 = new Vector();
    Collection c2 = new ArrayList(); // achieves the same with much better performance
  }
}
```
