By explicitly commenting empty method bodies it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional empty methods.
It gives the reader a better understanding of the meaning of that empty method.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {

  //Is this intentional? Why is this empty?
  public void bar() {
  }

  //This is a better approach
  public void good() {
    // This constructor is intentionally empty, because something something
  }
}
```
