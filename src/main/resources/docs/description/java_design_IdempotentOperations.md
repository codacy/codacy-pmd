Avoid idempotent operations - they have no effect. Idempotent operations are operations that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
Sometimes this is a bug, like the programmer mistyping similar names only differing by a letter or capitalization.
Code with no effects is like unused code, and should be fixed.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  public void bar() {
    int x = 2;
    int y = 3;

    x = x; //does nothing
    y = y; //does nothing
  }
}
```
