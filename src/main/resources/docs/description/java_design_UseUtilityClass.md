For classes that only have `static` methods, use them as utility classes.
Note that this doesn't apply to `abstract` classes, since their subclasses may well include non-static methods.
Also, if you want this class to be a utility class, remember to add a `private` constructor to prevent instantiation.

Ex:

```
public class MaybeAUtility {
  public static void foo() {

  }

  public static void bar() {

  }

  //Add this line
  private MaybeAUtility() { }
}
```
