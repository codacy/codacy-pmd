Deeply nested `if-then` statements are harder to read and error-prone to maintain.
Consider a more Object Oriented approach (using objects to delegate responsibilities), or break part of the logic into functions.
The technique to break some logic into functions is called `Extract Method`, support for it can be found under Refactoring options on most IDEs.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  public void bar(int x, int y, int z) {
    if (x>y) {
      if (y>z) {
        if (z==x) {
          // !! too deep
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
