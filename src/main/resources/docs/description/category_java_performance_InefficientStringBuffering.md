Since: PMD 3.4

Avoid concatenating non-literals in a StringBuffer constructor or append() since intermediate buffers will
need to be be created and destroyed by the JVM.

Example(s):
```
// Avoid this, two buffers are actually being created here
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("tmp = "+System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"));

// do this instead
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("tmp = ");
sb.append(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"));
```
