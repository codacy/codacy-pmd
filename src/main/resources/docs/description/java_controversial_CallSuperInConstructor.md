It is a good practice to call ```super()``` in a constructor.
Calling ```super()``` explicitly shows that the code is not evoking another super constructed (one with arguments).
Using this convention explicitly shows the code intention.

Ex:

```
public class Foo extends Bar{
  public Foo() {
   // call the constructor of Bar
   super();
  }
 public Foo(int code) {
  // do something with code
   this();
   // no problem with this
  }
}
```
