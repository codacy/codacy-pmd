Since: PMD 1.04

A high number of imports can indicate a high degree of coupling within an object. This rule 
counts the number of unique imports and reports a violation if the count is above the 
user-specified threshold.

Example(s):
```
import blah.blah.Baz;
import blah.blah.Bif;
// 18 others from the same package elided
public class Foo {
    public void doWork() {}
}
```
