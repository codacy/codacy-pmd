Since: PMD 3.6

Scriptlets should be factored into Tag Libraries or JSP declarations, rather than being part of JSP pages.

Example(s):
```
<HTML>
<HEAD>
<%
response.setHeader("Pragma", "No-cache");
%>
</HEAD>
    <BODY>
        <jsp:scriptlet>String title = "Hello world!";</jsp:scriptlet>
    </BODY>
</HTML>
```
