The method name and return type are suspiciously close to `hashCode()`, which may denote an intention to override the `hashCode()` method.
This simple misspell can induce huge bugs (The `object.hashCode` will be used instead).
If the method is called this way intentionally, you should consider changing the name of the method.


Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  public int hashcode() {
    // oops, this probably was supposed to be 'hashCode'

  }
}
```
