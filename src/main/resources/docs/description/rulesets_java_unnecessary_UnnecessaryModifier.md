Since: PMD 1.02

Fields in interfaces and annotations are automatically `public static final`, and methods are `public abstract`.
Classes, interfaces or annotations nested in an interface or annotation are automatically `public static`
(all nested interfaces and annotations are automatically static).
Nested enums are automatically `static`.
For historical reasons, modifiers which are implied by the context are accepted by the compiler, but are superfluous.

Example(s):
```
public @interface Annotation {
    public abstract void bar();     // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler
    public static final int X = 0;  // public, static, and final all ignored
    public static class Bar {}      // public, static ignored
    public static interface Baz {}  // ditto
}
public interface Foo {
    public abstract void bar();     // both abstract and public are ignored by the compiler
    public static final int X = 0;  // public, static, and final all ignored
    public static class Bar {}      // public, static ignored
    public static interface Baz {}  // ditto
}
public class Bar {
    public static interface Baz {}  // static ignored
    public static enum FoorBar {    // static ignored
        FOO;
    }
}
```
