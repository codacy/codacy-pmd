This rule uses the NCSS (Non-Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines of code for a given method. **NCSS ignores comments, and counts actual statements**.

Using this algorithm, lines of code that are split are counted as one.

Ex:

```
	public class Foo extends Bar {
		public int methd() {
			super.methd();

			//this space is ignored


			//this method only has 1 NCSS lines
			return 1;
		}
	}
```
