Individual character values provided as initialization arguments will be converted into `integers`. This can lead to internal buffer sizes that are larger than expected. Some examples:

Ex:

```
// misleading instantiation, these buffers
// are actually sized to 99 characters long
StringBuffer  sb1 = new StringBuffer('c');   
StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder('c');

// in these forms, just single characters are allocated
StringBuffer  sb3 = new StringBuffer("c");
StringBuilder sb4 = new StringBuilder("c");
```
