By explicitly commenting empty constructors it is easier to distinguish between intentional (commented) and unintentional empty constructors.
It gives the reader a better understanding of the meaning of that empty constructor.

Ex:

```
public class Bar {

  //Is this intentional? Why is this empty?
  public Bar() {
  }
}

public class Foo {

  //This is a better approach
  public Foo() {
    // This constructor is intentionally empty. (or some motive) Nothing special is needed here.
  }
}
```
