The method name and parameter number are suspiciously close to `equals(Object)`, which can denote an intention to override the `equals(Object)` method.
This simple misspell can induce huge bugs (The `object.equals` will be used instead).
If the method is called this way intentionally, you should consider changing the name of the method.

Ex:

```
public class Foo {
  public int equals(Object o) {
    // oops, this probably was supposed to be boolean equals
  }
  public boolean equals(String s) {
    // oops, this probably was supposed to be equals(Object)
  }
  public boolean equals(Object o1, Object o2) {
    // oops, this probably was supposed to be equals(Object)
  }
}
```
