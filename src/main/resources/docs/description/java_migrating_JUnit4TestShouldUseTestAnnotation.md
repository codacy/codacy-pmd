In JUnit 3, the framework executed all methods which started with the word `test` as a unit test. In JUnit 4, only methods annotated with the `@Test` annotation are executed.

Ex:

```
public class MyTest {
  public void testBad() {
    doSomething();
  }

  @Test
  public void testGood() {
    doSomething();
  }
}
```
