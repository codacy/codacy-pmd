Since: PMD 5.5.0

New objects created within loops should be checked to see if they can created outside them and reused.

Example(s):
```
public class Something {
    public static void main( String as[] ) {
        for (Integer i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id FROM Account];
        }
    }
}
```
