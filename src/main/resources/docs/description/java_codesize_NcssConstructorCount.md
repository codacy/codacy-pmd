This rule uses the NCSS (Non-Commenting Source Statements) algorithm to determine the number of lines of code for a given constructor.

**NCSS ignores comments**, and counts actual statements. Using this algorithm, **lines of code that are split are counted as one**.

Ex:

```
public class Foo extends Bar {
	public Foo() {
		super();


		//this constructor only has 1 NCSS lines
		super.foo();
	} 	
}
```
