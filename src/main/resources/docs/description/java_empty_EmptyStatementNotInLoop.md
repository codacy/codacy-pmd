An empty statement (or a semicolon by itself) that is not used as the sole body of a `for` or `while` loop is probably a bug.

It could also be a double semicolon, which has no purpose and therefore should be removed.

Ex:

```
public void doit() {
  // this is probably not what you meant to do
  ;
  // the extra semicolon here this is not necessary
  System.out.println(\"look at the extra semicolon\");;
}
```
