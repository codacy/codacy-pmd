The use of the keyword `volatile` is generally used to fine tune a Java application, and therefore, requires a good expertise of the Java Memory Model. Moreover, its range of action is somewhat misknown.

Therefore, the `volatile` keyword should not be used for maintenance purpose and portability.

Ex:

```
public class ThrDeux {
  private volatile String var1; // not suggested
  private String var2; // preferred
}
```
