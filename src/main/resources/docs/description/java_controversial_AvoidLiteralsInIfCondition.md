Avoid using hard-coded literals in conditional statements. By declaring them as static variables or private members with descriptive names **maintainability and readability** are enhanced.

**WARNING** This does not apply to '*magic numbers*' like -1 and 0.

Ex:

```
private static final int MAX_NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS = 10;
public void checkRequests() {
  if (i == 10) {
    // magic number, buried in a method
    doSomething();
  }

  if (i == MAX_NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS) {
    // preferred approach
    doSomething();
  }
}
```
