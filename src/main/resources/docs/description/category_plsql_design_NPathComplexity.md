Since: PMD 5.1

The NPath complexity of a method is the number of acyclic execution paths through that method.
A threshold of 200 is generally considered the point where measures should be taken to reduce 
complexity and increase readability.

Example(s):
```
CREATE OR REPLACE
PROCEDURE bar AS BEGIN  -- this is something more complex than it needs to be,
    if (y) THEN -- it should be broken down into smaller methods or functions
        for j IN 0 .. j-1 LOOP
            if (j > r) THEN
                doSomething;
                while (f < 5 ) LOOP
                    anotherThing;
                    f := f - 27;
                    END LOOP;
            else
                tryThis();
            END IF;
        END LOOP;
    END IF;
    if ( r - n > 45) THEN
        while (doMagic) LOOP
            findRabbits;
        END LOOP;
    END IF;
    BEGIN
        doSomethingDangerous();
    EXCEPTION WHEN FooException THEN
        makeAmends;
        BEGIN
            dontDoItAgain;
        EXCEPTION
        WHEN OTHERS THEN
            log_problem;
        END;
    END;
END;
```
