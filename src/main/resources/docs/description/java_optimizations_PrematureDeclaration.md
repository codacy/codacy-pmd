Checks for variables that are defined before they might be used.
A reference is deemed to be premature if it is created right before a block of code that doesnâ€™t use it that also has the ability to return or throw an `exception`.
In languages that support it, like Java, a good convention to follow is that variables should be declared and defined close to where they are first used.

Ex:

```
public int getLength(String[] strings) {

  int length = 0;	// declared prematurely

  if (strings == null || strings.length == 0) return 0;

  //length should be declared here

  for (String str : strings) {
    length += str.length();
  }

  return length;
}
```
