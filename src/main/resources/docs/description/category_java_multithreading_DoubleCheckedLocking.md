Since: PMD 1.04

Partially created objects can be returned by the Double Checked Locking pattern when used in Java.
An optimizing JRE may assign a reference to the baz variable before it calls the constructor of the object the
reference points to.

Note: With Java 5, you can make Double checked locking work, if you declare the variable to be `volatile`.

For more details refer to: &lt;http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-2001/jw-0209-double.html&gt;
or &lt;http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html&gt;

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    /*volatile */ Object baz = null; // fix for Java5 and later: volatile
    Object bar() {
        if (baz == null) { // baz may be non-null yet not fully created
            synchronized(this) {
                if (baz == null) {
                    baz = new Object();
                }
              }
        }
        return baz;
    }
}
```
