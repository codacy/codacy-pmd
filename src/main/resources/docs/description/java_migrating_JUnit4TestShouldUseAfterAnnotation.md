In JUnit 3, the `tearDown` method was used to clean up all data entities required in running tests. JUnit 4 skips the `tearDown` method and executes all methods annotated with `@After` after running each test

Ex:

```
public class MyTest {
  public void tearDown() {
    bad();
  }
}

public class MyTest2 {
  @After public void tearDown() {
    good();
  }
}
```
