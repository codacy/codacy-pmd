Since: PMD 6.13.0

This rule checks, that there are no tab characters (`\t`) in the source file.
It reports only the first occurrence per file.

Using tab characters for indentation is not recommended, since this requires that every developer
uses the same tab with in their editor.

This rule is the PMD equivalent of checkstyle's [FileTabCharacter](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_whitespace.html#FileTabCharacter) check.

Example(s):
```
