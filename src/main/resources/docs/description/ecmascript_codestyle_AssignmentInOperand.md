Since: PMD 5.0

Avoid assignments in operands; this can make code more complicated and harder to read.  This is sometime
indicative of the bug where the assignment operator '=' was used instead of the equality operator '=='.

Example(s):
```
var x = 2;
// Bad
if ((x = getX()) == 3) {
    alert('3!');
}

function getX() {
    return 3;
}
```
