Since: PMD 2.2

Exposing internal arrays to the caller violates object encapsulation since elements can be 
removed or replaced outside of the object that owns it. It is safer to return a copy of the array.

Example(s):
```
public class SecureSystem {
    UserData [] ud;
    public UserData [] getUserData() {
        // Don't return directly the internal array, return a copy
        return ud;
    }
}
```
