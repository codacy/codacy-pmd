Identifies a possible unsafe usage of a `static` field.
A `static` field can be accessed using the `class` instead of an instance of it (this is actually the correct usage of `static` fields).
This means a `static` field can be accessed before there is an instantiation of the class.
And as you can see in the example, the `static` variable is only initialized in the constructor.
So it is very possible that you access the variable before it is initialized.

Ex:

```
public class StaticField {
   static int x;
   public FinalFields(int y) {
    x = y; // unsafe
   }
}
```
