Non-constructor methods should not have the same name as the enclosing class.
Constructors and methods with the same name are confusing, and should be avoided.

Ex:

```
public class MyClass {

  public MyClass() {
    // this is OK because it is a constructor
  }		

  public void MyClass() {
    // this is bad because it is a method  
  }
}
```
