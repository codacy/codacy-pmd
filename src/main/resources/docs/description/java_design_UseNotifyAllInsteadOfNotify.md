`Thread.notify()` awakens a thread monitoring the object.
If more than one thread is monitoring, then only one is chosen.
The thread chosen is arbitrary, its usually safer to call `notifyAll()` instead.

Ex:

```
void bar() {
  // If many threads are monitoring x, only one (and you won't know which) will be notified.
  x.notify();

  // use instead:
  x.notifyAll();
}
```
