Since: PMD 4.2

Throwing exceptions within a 'finally' block is confusing since they may mask other exceptions 
or code defects.
Note: This is a PMD implementation of the Lint4j rule &quot;A throw in a finally block&quot;

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    public void bar() {
        try {
            // Here do some stuff
        } catch( Exception e) {
            // Handling the issue
        } finally {
            // is this really a good idea ?
            throw new Exception();
        }
    }
}
```
