Complexity directly affects maintenance costs is determined by the number of decision points in a method plus one for the method entry. The decision points include `if`, `while`, `for`, and `case` labels calls.

Generally, numbers ranging from **1-4** denote low complexity, **5-7** denote moderate complexity, **8-10** denote high complexity, and **11+** is very high complexity and it's not advised.

Ex:

```
public class Foo { // This has a Cyclomatic Complexity = 12

1	public void example() {
2		if (a == b) {
3			if (a1 == b1) {
				fiddle();
4				} else if (a2 == b2) {
					fiddle();
					} else {
						fiddle();
					}
5		} else if (c == d) {
6				while (c == d) {
					fiddle();
				}
7			} else if (e == f) {
8					for (int n = 0; n < h; n++) {
						fiddle();
				  }
			  } else {
			  	 switch (z) {
9						 case 1: fiddle();
						 	break;
10					 case 2: fiddle();
			  	 	 	break;
11		  	 	 case 3: fiddle();
			  	 		break;
12		  	 	 default: fiddle();
			  	 	 	break;
			  	 }
			 }
	}
}
```
