The God Class rule detects the God Class design flaw using metrics. God classes do too many things,
are very big and overly complex. They should be split apart to be more object-oriented.
The rule uses the detection strategy described in &quot;Object-Oriented Metrics in Practice&quot;.
The violations are reported against the entire class.
