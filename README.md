# Codacy PMDJava

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [PMDJava](https://pmd.github.io/) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
Check the **Docs** section for more information.

## Usage

#### Publish the docker

```
sbt 'set version in Docker := "dev"' 'set name := "pmd"' docker:publishLocal
```

#### Run the docker

```
docker run --user=docker --rm=true -v <PATH-TO-CODE>:/src -v <PATH-TO>/ruleset.xml:/src/ruleset.xml codacy/pmd:dev
```
> Make sure all the volumes mounted have the right permissions for user `docker`

#### Generate Docs

```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.pmd.DocGenerator rulesets"
```

**Only patterns.json and description.json**
```sh
sbt "run-main codacy.pmd.DocGenerator"
```
