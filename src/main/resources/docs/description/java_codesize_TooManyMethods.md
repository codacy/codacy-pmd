A class with too many methods is probably a good suspect for refactoring, in order to reduce its complexity and find a way to have more fine grained objects.

Making your Classes have less methods that do generic stuff will make your code more modular and therefore reusable in the long term.

Ex:

```
	public class Foo {
		public void bar1() { //inside it does something }
		[.........]
		public void barn() { //it will more stuff}
	}
```
