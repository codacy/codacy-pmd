Do not use `protected` methods in `final` classes since they cannot be subclassed.
This should only be allowed in `final` classes that extend other classes with `protected` methods (whose visibility cannot be reduced).
Clarify your intent by using `private` or `package` access modifiers instead (`package` access modifier is attained by using no modifier keyword).

Ex:

```
public final class Foo {
  private int bar() {

  }
  protected int baz() {
    // Foo cannot be subclassed, and doesn't extend anything, so is baz() really private or package visible?
  }
}
```
