Since: PMD 1.8

Code should never throw NullPointerExceptions under normal circumstances.  A catch block may hide the 
original error, causing other, more subtle problems later on.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    void bar() {
        try {
            // do something
        } catch (NullPointerException npe) {
        }
    }
}
```
