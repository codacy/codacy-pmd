The dataflow analysis tracks local definitions, undefinitions and references to variables on different paths on the data flow. From those informations there can be found various problems.

* **UR - Anomaly**: There is a reference to a variable that was not defined before. This is a bug and leads to an error.
* **DU - Anomaly**: A recently defined variable is undefined. These anomalies may appear in normal source text.
* **DD - Anomaly**: A recently defined variable is redefined. This is ominous but donâ€™t have to be a bug.

Ex:

```
public void foo() {
	int buz = 5;
	buz = 6; // redefinition of buz -> dd-anomaly
	foo(buz);
	buz = 2;
} // buz is undefined when leaving scope -> du-anomaly
```
