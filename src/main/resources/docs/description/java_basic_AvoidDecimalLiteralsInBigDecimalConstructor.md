One might assume that the result of `new BigDecimal(0.1)` is exactly equal to `0.1`,
but it is actually equal to `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`.
This is because `0.1` cannot be represented exactly as a double (or as a binary fraction of any finite length).
Thus, the long value that is being passed in to the constructor is not exactly equal to `0.1`, appearances notwithstanding.

The String constructor, on the other hand, is perfectly predictable: `new BigDecimal(“0.1”)` is exactly equal to `0.1`, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the String constructor be used in preference to this one.

Ex:

```
BigDecimal bd = new BigDecimal(1.123);		// loss of precision, this would trigger the rule

BigDecimal bd = new BigDecimal("1.123");   	// preferred approach

BigDecimal bd = new BigDecimal(12);     	// preferred approach, ok for integer values
```
