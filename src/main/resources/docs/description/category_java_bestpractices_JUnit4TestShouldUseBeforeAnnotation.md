Since: PMD 4.0

In JUnit 3, the setUp method was used to set up all data entities required in running tests.
JUnit 4 skips the setUp method and executes all methods annotated with @Before before all tests.
JUnit 5 introduced @BeforeEach and @BeforeAll annotations to execute methods before each test or before all tests in the class, respectively.

Example(s):
```
public class MyTest {
    public void setUp() {
        bad();
    }
}
public class MyTest2 {
    @Before public void setUp() {
        good();
    }
}
```
