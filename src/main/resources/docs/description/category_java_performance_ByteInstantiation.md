Since: PMD 4.0

Calling new Byte() causes memory allocation that can be avoided by the static Byte.valueOf().
It makes use of an internal cache that recycles earlier instances making it more memory efficient.

Example(s):
```
public class Foo {
    private Byte i = new Byte(0); // change to Byte i = Byte.valueOf(0);
}
```
